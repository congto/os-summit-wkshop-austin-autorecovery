# Open browser and connect to the OpenStack server IP 
https://<OpenStack Server IP>

# Click around and heck out your cloud as if you just got to work and want to make sure things are working

# SSH to the OpenStack server
ssh <OpenStack Server IP> -l student01

# Take RootSudo role (enter your StudentID password when prompted)
sudo su

# Execute the following command to discover the Utility container IP
lxc-ls --fancy |grep utility

Working example output will look similar to this:

allinone_utility_container-db74af6c              RUNNING  10.0.3.17, 172.29.238.250 ...

Please note the second IP address starting with 172.x.238.x

# SSH to the Utility container
ssh <Utility container IP>

# Source the openrc file with the cloud credentials
source openrc

# Execute a few CLI commands
openstack endpoint list
openstack service list
openstack user list
openstack project list
openstack hypervisor list
openstack compute service list


# Pause here for further instructions, then proceed to Step 2
